## How to run the code

On GitHub, click the green Code<> box and copy the SSH key

Open up `Terminal` application on your desktop

Run `git clone paste_ssh_here`

Run `ls` it will list all the files on your computer, `info-4609` should be on there

Run `cd info-4609` to enter the folder of the project

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

It´ll ask to open up Google Chrome, allow it to deploy the project and it should be running on a website called
`localhost`

The app is live and interactable!
Refreshing the website will reset the state of the program and there is no data being stored anywhere, this is just a
framework.

To shut down the program, type `^C` into the `Terminal` application to terminate the program from running infinitely in
your computer
